# Review of the Blog on MINIMO

> *This blog is a review of the blog [**"MINIMO: When AI Takes on Maths"**](https://gist.github.com/anion-hawk/6ed0b0cc4709163e4f1bff8e856ef0b1). This review blog is co-authored by [Faria Binta Awal](https://github.com/f12-mou), [Md. Ishrak Ahsan](https://github.com/ishrak26), and [Riad Ahmed Anonto](https://github.com/Anonto050), all undergraduate seniors at CSE, BUET.*

## Strengths

1. **Conciseness**:
   - The blog provides a clear and concise overview of MINIMO. It is very easy to understand the flow of how it generates conjectures and solves them.
   - Logical blocks such as the starting point (axioms), conjecture generation, theorem proving, and hindsight relabeling are well-organized and explained.

2. **Readers' Attention**:
   - The casual tone and relatable examples, such as references to "Deep Thought" and HAL 9000, make the blog more engaging for the audience.

3. **Flow and Structure**:
   - The blog progresses logically from explaining the problem MINIMO addresses to its methodology, experiments, results, and limitations.
   - The transition between sections is good.
4. **Well defined Key Concepts**:
   - The explanation of intrinsic motivation, constrained decoding, and the self-improving feedback loop highlights the unique aspects of MINIMO.

## Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Examples**:
   - The blog does not provide a concrete example demonstrating the full flow of MINIMO. For instance, an example of how a conjecture is generated, proved, and refined would make the process more tangible.

2. **Brief Explanation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
   - The description of MCTS is very brief and does not elaborate on its mechanics, such as how it balances exploration and exploitation or constructs proof steps.

Overall, the blog does an excellent job of presenting MINIMO in an engaging manner. Addressing the weaknesses above would make it even more impactful for a broader audience.
